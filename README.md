# Project 2 - News site

### What is this?

A news site created for a fictitious aviation magazine company.

### What did I do?

In this assigment (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019/2020) I was given the task to create a news or magazine site. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The navbar changes depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site has a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there are four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets, and on mobiles there are just one card on each row. At the end of the site there is also a footer.

### Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS

### Learning objectives

- How to structure webpages using box model.
- Layout webpages using flexbox.
- Create responsive webpages for mobile, desktop and tablet.

### Where can you see the site in action?
