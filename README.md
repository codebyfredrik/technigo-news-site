# Project 2 - News site (Week 2)

### 1. What is this?

In this assigment (@ Technigo Boot Camp 2019/2020) I was given the task to create a news or magazine site. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The navbar changes depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site has a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there are four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets, and on mobiles there are just one card on each row. At the end of the site there is also a footer.
